<template>
  <div class="container mt-5">
    <div class="col-md-10">
    <h1 class="mb-4">Deliverables</h1>
    <h2>Link to Test My Component:</h2>
    <p>to answer the questions in the test, I have created a web application using the Vue.js framework.</p>
    <p>To test the component that responds to deliverable questions, click the button:</p>
    <button class="btn btn-primary mb-3"><router-link to="/skills" class="text-white">Skills Finder</router-link></button>
    <p>This component has an input label to find a Torre user and their skills.</p>
    <p>All skills have a button to display more information related to the user, such as proficiency, weight, and recommendations.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> 
      <p>WARNING: If you click on the "Get Skills" button without listing any skills, it is likely that the endpoint does not work due to a CORS problem.</p>
      <p>This is because the endpoint https://torre.bio/api/bios/$username is experiencing CORS issues.</p>
      <p>To test the component, you must visit the following link: <a href="https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://torre.bio/api/bios/gaenrale" class="text-primary">https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://torre.bio/api/bios/username</a> and request temporary access to the demo server.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Review My Code Through a Version Control System</h2>
    <p>I use GitHub to control the version of my web application code.</p>
    <p>Github project: <a href="https://github.com/geramirezl/fronttesttorre" class="text-primary">https://github.com/geramirezl/fronttesttorre</a> </p>
    <h2>What Else Could I Have Improved if I Had More Time?</h2>
    <p>If I had more time, I could have fixed the CORS issue by exploring the possibility of modifying the CORS access on the server, eliminating the need to rely on external projects to solve the CORS problem. Additionally, I could have created my own API or backend logic and connected it to this frontend. I could have also improved the styling of the webpage.</p>
     <p>Moreover, I could have implemented additional features, such as allowing users to search for specific skills instead of just searching for Torre users.</p> 
     <p>For the backend logic, I have created a basic relational model to design the database, which is illustrated in the image below:</p>
     <img src="testTorre.drawio.png" alt="database model">
     <p>If I had more time, I would have improved the database model and utilized it for the backend logic.</p>
